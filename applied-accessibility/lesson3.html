<!-- Camper Cat wants a page on his site dedicated to becoming a ninja. Help him fix the headings so his markup gives semantic 
    meaning to the content, and shows the proper parent-child relationships of his sections. Change all the h5 tags to the 
    proper heading level to indicate they are subsections of the h2 ones. Use h3 tags for the purpose. -->
