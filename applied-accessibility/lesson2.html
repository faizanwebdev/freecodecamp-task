<!-- Camper Cat has coded a skeleton page for the blog part of his website. He's planning to add a visual 
    break between his two articles with a decorative image of a samurai sword. Add an alt attribute to the img 
    tag and set it to an empty string. (Note that the image src doesn't link to an actual file - don't worry 
    that there are no swords showing in the display.) -->
